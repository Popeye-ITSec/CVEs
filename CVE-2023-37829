> [Attack Vectors]
> An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary and potentially
> malicious JavaScript code into the notification.message field that is executed when the web page
> is accessed. The vulnerable field is a notification function, which is built as a kind of chat in
> connection with task creation, where malicious JavaScript code can be injected. When the task is
> saved, the code is executed each time the open or closed tasks are displayed. Payload: <Img src = x onerror = "javascript: window.onerror = alert; throw XSS">
